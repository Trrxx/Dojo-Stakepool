# Welcome to Dojo Stakepool
We are Live!! As of epoch 358 (08/18/22) we are now offically ready stake!!

### Updates (November 28th, 2023)
Great news everyone. DOJO has teamed up with WKU Canada as the official recepient of DOJO's sponsorships. DOJO and WKU Canada are still experimenting with breakdown options on how to sponsor youth best. We currently plan on deviding the sponsorship percentage in 2, where the first half will be available through a application based program for low income famillies. The second half of the sponsorship percentage will be available to anyone (under the age of 18) and we plan on selecting the winner through a raffle process to promote decentralisation and fairness to all. 

Currently, DOJO has earned enough rewards from the previous year and a quarter to sponsor youth at the 2024 WKU National Championships hosted in Calgary, early summer. We will update our page on what the sponsorship is and what our next steps are very soon.

This is a massive step for our community and an increadible opertunity to bridge our two entities and come together to support children doing what they love. Thank you to everyone deligating with us and your continued support.

### Updates (May 22nd 2023)
After 3/4 of the last year of being operational, DOJO has successfully minted 3 blocks. Our delegators are making money and 3% of the earnings from all rewards will be given to children at random at martial arts sporting events. Our social media outlets were created and have been growing in followers. Instagram, Facebook and YouTube pages for DOJO stakepool have been created.

What's Next?

DOJO Stakepool is ever growing and we require delegation at saturated (K) levels in order maximize rewards both for delegators and recipients of the support DOJO aims to provide. To acheive higher K and move closer to achieving our mission statemnet, We are focused on the following:
  1. Social media growth, this will help DOJO earn more deligators 
  2. Strive for perfect system operations, we are looking into redundencies for power and internet, without which nodes will fail. We are also considering building more relays      for better and faster communication with the Cardano network. (We do not want to risk, missing or ghosting blocks in the minting process.)
  3. Selecting a partner orginization that will both help market DOJO and allow us provide sponsorships to its children and youth members in a un-biased fasion. 

### Who are we?
Based out of a small town in northern British Columbia, Canada, we are devoted to the support and growth of children. We here at DOJO stakepool are using the Cardano platform to try and help support children and youth, and follow and accomplish thier dreams while bridging the world of crypto to the sport martial arts world.

### How do we plan on accomplishing this?
Using a percentage of the earnings this pool makes, we devote 3% towards funding or sponsoring children chosen at random at martial arts sporting events throughout the year. Once this pool operates at saterated levels, we hope to support 100k+ ADA in donations yearly to children and youth. We are interested in donating anything from equipment, training, travel expenses, and regestration fees to competitiors for martial arts tournaments.

### Can you help?
Yes! To help us achieve our goal, you can stake with us using your cardano wallets of choice that support staking protocols (eg daedelus wallet).
Ticker: DOJO

Otherwise please check out our socials listed below, like and share DOJO and help us get our community growing.  

### How to stake?
  1. In order to stake you will need to have Cardano (ADA) perchased and stored in a cardano wallet that suports cardano's POS protocols. 
  2. Now that you have your wallet and ADA stored you will need to select which stakepool you would like to delegate to, if you would like to delegate to us, our ticker        is: DOJO
  3. Now that you have chosen your stakepool, confirm the transaction (at time of writing the transaction fee is around 2 ADA). It should be noted that the stake pool you choose does not get access to any of your stored crypto. Only the individual who has access to your wallet (recovery phrase) has access to the funds. what you are delegating is the right of staking under Cardano's POS protocols.
  4. It will take 1-2 Epochs (5 to 10 days) before you the delegation starts and the very earliesty you could see your first rewards.
  5.  Thats it! Be on the lookout for rewards under the rewards tab and check back with us for updates on sponsored competators.

### Why Cardano and not other proof of stake blockchains?
Being massive fans and advocates of decentralization, as well as having a community oriented drive, we find Cardano to be a perfect match as it is also founded upon these princaples.
