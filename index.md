## Welcome to Sensei-Stakepool

### Who are we?
Devoted to the support of youth growth and activity, we here at Sensei-stakepool are trying to bridge the world of crypto to the sport karate world. Using the Cardano platform, we are trying to introduce more user adoption as well as help children accomplish thier dreams within sports karate.

### How?
Using a small percentage of the earnings this pool makes, we devote 2% towards funding or sponsoring children chosen at random at karate sporting events throuout the year.

### Can you help?
Yes! To help us achieve our goal, you can stake with us using your cardano wallet of choice that support staking protocols (eg daedelus wallet).
